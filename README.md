### Timed-Quiz

This application is a timed quiz designed to test peers and myself on our knowledge of javascript. It is close to finished but there is still some polish left to make the application look smoother as well as display high scores after they have been stored. The application as it is now will display to you a series of five questions that when answered correctly will add points to your score and when answered incorrectly will deduct time. When all the questions are answered a final score will be rendered to the page and there will be a option to put your name in and save your score under your initials.
